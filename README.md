#   🌦️ Weather BI Dashboard (API-Driven)




### 📌 Project Overview

This project delivers an interactive Business Intelligence dashboard built using real-time weather and air-quality data fetched from a public API.The dashboard provides current conditions, 7-day forecasts, air quality insights, and city-wise comparisons to support quick, data-driven decisions.

### 🎯 Objectives


  - Ingest real-time weather data using APIs.    
  - Transform semi-structured JSON data into analytical tables.   
  - Visualize current weather conditions and short-term forecasts.  
  - Monitor Air Quality Index (AQI) and health impact levels. 
  - Build a clean, user-friendly BI dashboard.

City-specific weather metrics


### 🌡️ Current Weather KPIs


Temperature (°C)

Humidity

Wind Speed (kph)

Atmospheric Pressure

UV Index

Visibility

Precipitation

### 📅 7-Day Forecast


Day-wise temperature trend visualization

Helps identify short-term climate patterns

### 🌅 Solar Information


Sunrise & Sunset timings

🌫️Air Quality Index (AQI)

PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO₂, SO₂, O₃

Health classification: Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups.

### 🌧️ Rain Probability


Day-wise chances of rainfall (%).

### 🔍 Key Insights


Pune shows clear weather with moderate temperature (~28°C).

AQI levels indicate health risks for sensitive groups due to elevated PM2.5 and CO.

Temperature peaks mid-week before stabilizing.

Low precipitation probability suggests dry conditions.


### 💡 Business Value


Enables quick interpretation of weather conditions.

Supports planning for travel, outdoor activities, and operations.

Highlights air quality risks for health-sensitive users.
